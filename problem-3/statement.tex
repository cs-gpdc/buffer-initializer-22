**Challenge Name**  
Slow PC

**Description**  
Find the intersection of lists

**Problem Statement**  
As a Google PhD Fellowship student interested in systems research, [Erika](https://hunhoffe.github.io/) enjoys tackling the unique challenges in resource management. She wants to create a simple utility program that displays the top processes with high usage of system resources.  
Given a list $L1$ of top $N$ PIDs (process id) with high memory usage and another list $L2$ of top $N$ PIDs with high CPU usage, find the list of PIDs with both high memory and high CPU usage, sorted in ascending order.

**Input Format**  
The first line contains an integer $N$, the number of processes.  
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers, the list $L1$ of top $N$ PIDs with high memory usage.  
The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers, the list $L2$ of top $N$ PIDs with high CPU usage.  

**Constraints**  
$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$  
$1 \leq L1[i], L2[i] \leq 10^9$  
It is guaranteed that lists $L1$ and $L2$ do not contain duplicate PIDs.

**Output Format**  
The line containing space-separated integers, the list of PIDs with both high memory and high CPU usage, sorted in ascending order.

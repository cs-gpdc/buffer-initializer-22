**Challenge Name**  
Diophantine Dilemma

**Description**  
Calculate the area of the right triangle

**Problem Statement**  
Sagar has always been fascinated by [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry). He just learned that, as proved by [Fermat's right triangle theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_right_triangle_theorem), there are no [Pythagorean triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple) that share two out of three numbers. This implies that, given any two of the three numbers in a Pythagorean triple, it is possible to identify the unique Pythagorean triple. Sagar wants to test this thereom.  
Given any two sides of a [right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle), calculate the area of the triangle. 

**Input Format**  
The first line contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $Q$, the two sides of the triangle.

**Constraints**  
$1 \leq P, Q \leq 1000$  
It is guaranteed that there exists a Pythagorean triple containing $P$ and $Q$.

**Output Format**  
An integer $A$ that denotes the area of the triangle.

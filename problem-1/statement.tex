**Challenge Name**  
Don't SHOUT

**Description**  
Find the capitalization count

**Problem Statement**  
Using all caps in a message is often interpreted as SHOUTING or SCREAMING and is discouraged. Abhishek, a student pursuing research in NLP, knows this better than anyone else. He is working on a sentiment analysis problem, and as a part of feature engineering, he wants to create a feature that tells whether a message contains more shouting, i.e., capitalization than usual. If the number of uppercase letters is strictly greater than the number of lowercase letters, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No". IGNORE ANY CHARACTER THAT IS NOT A LETTER.

**Input Format**  
Entire first line, the message $S$  
**Note:** The message may contain spaces; use appropriate input functions to read the entire line, not just the first word.

**Constraints**  
$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^3$

**Output Format**  
Print "Yes" or "No" (without quotes)
